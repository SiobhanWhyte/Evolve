             Morgan was a highly competitive sports player and played to a high standard in basketball, football, and GAA. Morgan qualified as a fitness professional in 2014. From here he worked locally for 2 years before deciding to go out on his own. Morgan set up home help fitness and nutrition blocks and he set up sky blue fitness on his own out in Allenwood. Morgan also worked coaching Gymnastics in Panthers Academy for 18 months. In June 2017 Morgan got keys to my own unit here in Newbridge and set up Evolve Strength and Fitness.

                Serena is the second in command and the gym would not function or run without her. She can do it all and really has grown into such an amazing coach and her story is inspiring. She is now doing Personal Training as well as coaching both adult and kids classes at the gym and all this while being a super busy mum as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                Serena's story is amazing and goes from being a stay-at-home mother to becoming an amazing coach and she continues to amaze and inspire to this day.
                Morgan met Serena when she took his first-ever fitness class over 6 years ago. All she knew was that she wanted to get a bit fitter and healthier and in Morgan’s first-ever class as a coach, she turned up for a 6.15 am class and here they are 6 years on. Morgan coached her first, then they worked in Gymnastics together and when she spoke about getting into fitness and going back to get qualified as a fitness instructor Morgan was delighted to help her out and advise on where she could start.

            <p>
              Yvonne joined Evolve Strength and Fitness over 2 years ago now and before joining as a coach she started attending the Bootcamp classes with her entourage. Morgan would have known about Yvonne as she herself is a fitness professional and Morgan knew she used to run her own classes. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The decision to take Yvonne on board as a coach was most definitely the right one. As a person, Yvonne is genuine and honest and she has a fantastic circle of friends and family which would further enhance that fact. She is an excellent fitness instructor and certainly knows her stuff. Her everyday job working with kids is tough but again the work that she does shows you just how caring, thoughtful, and passionate she is about her work and she is the exact same when it comes to health and fitness. 
              Yvonne has grown and developed so much and is now stronger and fitter than ever and she would probably live in the gym if Morgan let her. 
              Morgan has great pleasure in calling her a colleague and a friend and hopes that she stays with Evolve for many years to come.

              We are delighted to welcome Ed as our newest Coach to Evolve. Ed as a coach has been heavily involved in sport and has been hugely active and giving in his time to Newbridge Town Soccer Club where he has been involved in training both underage and senior teams for many years. 
              </p>
              <p>
              Nearly 18 months ago now Ed furthered his education when he completed the KG Elite Strength and Conditioning course and has grown even more now as a coach.
              Ed as a person is an absolute pleasure to be around and as you might know, he has been training at the gym over the last 2 years. To say he is passionate about fitness and coaching is an understatement. Ed puts a huge focus on being technical and supportive as a coach with regards to the gym and classes, Ed is more than qualified and knows how we operate and Morgan was thrilled when Ed said he would love to do some cl
              asses from time to time and help cover when he is available.
              </p>
              <p>
              Ed will be heading up the Sunday Drop-in sessions as we grow and offer more options at Evolve, watch out for more on these classes in the future.</p>
