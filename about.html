      <h5>HOW IT STARTED</h5>
      <h3>evolve</h3>
      <p>We have been in business for 4 years now going in to year number 5. We pride ourselves on quality of coaching and every class that we do can be tailored and altered to suit any individual with all movements aswell as alternatives and progressions demonstrated by our qualified team of coaches. We also cap all of our classes at the gym to guarantee that everyone feels comfortable and has plenty of space and this results in a better delivery of the class anf the knowledge that you will always be looked after and monitored by our coaches. We cater for both adults and kids at the gym. We currently have 9 kids clasees at the gym throughout the week as we transform the gym into a gymnastics playground and for our adults we have a timetable of 27 classes a week.
        We offer 2 types of class for adults.
        Bootcamp
        Strength and conditioning.
        
        Bootcamp classes are hugely popular and will guarantee an overall improvement in both strength and fitness levels. All classes are done within the hour incorporating warm up, demonstration, workout and cooldown. The combination of movements from weighted to bodyweight and the huge variety in structure and adaptation changing work and rest times and intensity levels really does help improve all aspects of your health and fitness. All of this is done in a fun and challenging way and we never do the same workout twice. We always offer your first class free and this is the best way tonsee what we do and you will know straight away if we are a fit for you.
        
        Strength and conditioning.
        We like to offer a progression for people and these classes are more advanced as we start to include structured programming around strength training and also include more complex movements with barbells and more intense conditioning sessions. These classes are 1 hour and 15 mins long and are not a drop in option. The benefits from these classes will only come with long term consistency and doing an odd class every now again is pointless. We have our own unique structure to these classes and we have an amazing and dedicated strength crew who train with us at the gym and who have been going from strength to strength. </p>

            <h4>Coach Serena</h4>
            <p>Serena's story is amazing and goes from being a stay at home mother to becoming an amazing coach and she continues to amaze and inspire to this day.
              I met Serena when I took my first ever fitness class over 6 years ago. All she knew was that she wanted to get a bit fitter and healthier and in my first ever class as a coach she turned up for a 6.15am class and here we are 6 years on and I have been around her since. I coached her first, then we worked in Gymnastics together and when she spoke about getting into fitness and going back to get qualified as a fitness instructor I was delighted to help her out and advise on where she could start. Serena is the second in command and the gym would not function or run without her. She can do it all and really has grown into such an amazing coach and her story is inspiring. She is now doing Personal Training as well as coaching both adult and kids classes at the gym and all this while being a super busy mum aswell.

            <h4>Coach Yvonne Flynn</h4>
            <p>

              Yvonne joined Evolve Strength and Fitness over 2 year's ago now and before joining as a coach she started attending the bootcamp classes with her entourageðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜…. I would have known about Yvonne as she herself is a fitness professional and I knew she used to run her own classes. I also know her brother through GAA and it was great to have her in to train.
              
              The decision to take Yvonne on board as a coach was most definitely the right one. As a person I find Yvonne to be very genuine and honest and she has a fantastic circle of friends and family which would further enhance that fact. She is an excellent fitness instructor and certainly knows her stuff. Her everyday job working with kids is tough but again the work that she does shows you just how caring, thoughtful and passionate she is about her work and she is the exact same when it comes to health and fitness. 
              Yvonne has grown and developed so much and is now stronger and fitter than ever and she would probably live in the gym if I let her. 
              I have great pleasure in calling her a colleague and a friend and I hope she stay with us for many years to come.
              
              Yvonnes qualifications:
              
              2016:  National Qualification in exercise, Heath studies and personal training, 
              2016: National Qualification in pre and post natal exercise
