      <h1>EVOLVE COMMUNITY</h1>
    <p>We have been in business for 4 years now going in to year number 5. We pride ourselves on quality of coaching and every class that we do can be tailored and altered to suit any individual with all movements aswell as alternatives and progressions demonstrated by our qualified team of coaches.</p>
    <p>We also cap all of our classes at the gym to guarantee that everyone feels comfortable and has plenty of space and this results in a better delivery of the class anf the knowledge that you will always be looked after and monitored by our coaches.</p>
    <p> We cater for both adults and kids at the gym. We currently have 9 kids clasees at the gym throughout the week as we transform the gym into a gymnastics playground and for our adults we have a timetable of 27 classes a week.</p>
    <p>We offer 2 types of class for adults. Bootcamp Strength and conditioning. Bootcamp classes are hugely popular and will guarantee an overall improvement in both strength and fitness levels.</p>
    <p>All classes are done within the hour incorporating warm up, demonstration, workout and cooldown. The combination of movements from weighted to bodyweight and the huge variety in structure and adaptation changing work and rest times and intensity levels really does help improve all aspects of your health and fitness. </p>
    <p>All of this is done in a fun and challenging way and we never do the same workout twice.</p> 
    <p>We always offer your first class free and this is the best way tonsee what we do and you will know straight away if we are a fit for you. Strength and conditioning.</p>
    <p>We like to offer a progression for people and these classes are more advanced as we start to include structured programming around strength training and also include more complex movements with barbells and more intense conditioning sessions.</p> 
    <p> These classes are 1 hour and 15 mins long and are not a drop in option. The benefits from these classes will only come with long term consistency and doing an odd class every now again is pointless.</p> 
    <p>We have our own unique structure to these classes and we have an amazing and dedicated strength crew who train with us at the gym and who have been going from strength to strength. </p>
