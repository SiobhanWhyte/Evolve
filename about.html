                </p>
                <p>
                Serena's story is amazing and goes from being a stay-at-home mother to becoming an amazing coach and she continues to amaze and inspire to this day.

            <img src="static/images/profile-yvonne.jpg" alt="Yvonne Trainer">
          </div>
            <p>
              Yvonne joined Evolve Strength and Fitness over 2 years ago now and before joining as a coach she started attending the Bootcamp classes with her entourage and she used to run her own fitness classes before joining Evolve
              </p>
              <p>
              The decision to take Yvonne on board as a coach was most definitely the right one. As a person, Yvonne is genuine and honest and she has a fantastic circle of friends and family which would further enhance that fact. She is an excellent fitness instructor and certainly knows her stuff. Her everyday job working with kids is tough but again the work that she does shows you just how caring, thoughtful, and passionate she is about her work and she is the exact same when it comes to health and fitness. 
              Yvonne has grown and developed so much and is now stronger and fitter than ever and she would probably live in the gym if Morgan let her.
